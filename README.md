# Our-Pipe: Simple GUI application to download YouTube videos, written in Rust.

## I created this program mostly to practice and improve my Rust skills, as well as create an easy-to-use youtube downloading program for my friends and family to use.
## It is very basic right now, and most likely has a lot of hidden issues and bugs, but it works! (on my computer at least ¯\\\__(ツ)\_/¯)
